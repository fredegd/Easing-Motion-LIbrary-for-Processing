# Easing Methods  

An EasyEase object contains a set of methods that reproduce the most common interpolation curves:

- [Exponential easing](#Exponential-easing)
- [Sinusoidal easing](#Sinusoidal-Easing)
- [Circular easing](#Circular-easing)
- [Elastic easing](#Elastic-Easing)
- [easing Bounce](#Bounce-Easing)
- [easing Back](#Back-Easing)

# Exponential Easing

Exponential easing accelerates or decelerates motion based on the value of the exponential factor.
the higher the factor, the steeper the curve

### .in()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .out()
It starts fast and progressively slows down,

### .inOut()
It starts slow, accelerates until reaching full-speed at the midpoint, then and progressively slows down.

# Sinusoidal Easing

Sinusoidal easing applies a sinusoidal function to the motion, resulting in a smooth, wave-like transition, providing a gentle acceleration and deceleration.

### .inSine()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .outSine()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .inOutSine()
It starts slow, accelerates until reaching full-speed at the midpoint, then and progressively slows down.

# Circular Easing

Circular easing follows a circular motion pattern. This method is characterized by its rounded curves

### .inCirc()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .outCirc()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .inOutCirc()
It starts slow, accelerates until reaching full-speed at the midpoint, then and progressively slows down.

# Elastic Easing

Elastic easing simulates an elastic or rubber band-like motion, causing the object to overshoot its target before settling into the final position. This method is useful for creating bouncy animations.
### .inElastic()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .outElastic()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .inOutElastic()
It starts slow, accelerates until reaching full-speed at the midpoint, then and progressively slows down.

# Bounce Easing

Bounce easing mimics the behavior of a bouncing ball, introducing a series of bounces as the motion progresses.
This method adds a dynamic animation, resembling the way objects bounce in the real world.

### .inBounce()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .outBounce()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .inOutBounce()
It starts slow, accelerates until reaching full-speed at the midpoint, then and progressively slows down.  

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

# Back Easing

Back easing incorporates a brief overshoot before settling into the target position. This method is characterized by a slight backward motion before moving forward, creating an effect similar to pulling back and releasing a spring.

### .inBack()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .outBack()
It starts slowly and progressively speeds up,

### .inOutBack()
It starts slow, accelerates until reaching full-speed at the midpoint, then and progressively slows down.
