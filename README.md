# EasyEase library for Processing

### A collection of utility Functions for Easing motions and non linear distribution


The library provides a collection of function to help calculate the most common Easing Curves 
- Exponential
- Sinusoidal
- Circular
- Back
- Bounce
- Elastic

### Get Started:

The esiest apporoach to get started with EasyEase in Processing is:

- import the library
````
import easy.ease.*
````

- initialize an instance of EasyEase Class object and give it a name, for example ```mover```
````
EasyEase mover;
````

- in the setup() declare the EasyEase object initialized before
````
setup(){
size(600, 600);
mover = new EasyEase(this);
}
  ````

- in the draw() an practical and convenient way to access the objectÂ´s build in functions is to call the desired Easing function method, and pass  in a ```counter```value (default between 0 and 1), a ```start``` value and an ```end``` value as parameters like in the example:
````
  float start = 50;
  float stop = width-50;
  float x = mover.out(counter,start, stop);
  
  ellipse(x,height/2,100,100);
````
